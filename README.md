# Shopify Theme Actions

A set of GitHub Actions to enable fast Shopify theme development workflows:

**DEPLOYMENT_PREVIEW**  
Creates a new Shopify theme for each PR. If a PR specific theme already exists it will be updated (i.e. on a `git push` after the PR was created).

**DEPLOY**  
Deploys to the specified Shopify theme, useful for defined, testing / staging / production themes.
